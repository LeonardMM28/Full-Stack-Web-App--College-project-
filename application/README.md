# Build/Run Instructions

## Build Instructions

1. Install node.js locally (npm install).
2. Build the database locally (npm run builddb).

## Run Instructions 

1. Make sure to include the ".env" file in the application folder.
2. Execute "npm start" to start the server, ready to try the app!

# Extra features implemented

1. Toggle private videos option.
2. Select an avatar icon when creating a user.
3. Keeping track of each post's views.
4. Page of other profiles with their posts.
5. The whole application is SLIGHTLY responsive when the window shrinks, and a different nav bar is displayed for smaller screens.

# Bugs/Potential improvements

1. No distinction between uppercase/lowercase characters in username. Make usernames case sensible for the ddatabase.
2. No message or alert to confirm that a user has been created succesfully. Implementation using JavaScript (tried) since flash messages need an active session.
3. When names or descriptions in posts are too long, the design of the post breaks a bit when displaying it. Implementation of a better and adaptative CSS layout.
